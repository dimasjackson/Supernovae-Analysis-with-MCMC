# Supernovae-Analysis-with-MCMC

In this project we will use the Pantehon+SH0ES data of 1701 supernovae distances and the EMCEE algorithm of Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate cosmological parameters using Bayesian Statistics. We want to marginalise over the the Hubble parameter, the matter density and the radiation density parameter.
