# Supernovae-Analysis-with-MCMC

In this project we will use the Pantheon+SH0ES luminosity distances data of 1701 Supernovae to estimate cosmological parameters. The parameters that we are interested in are the Hubble constant, the matter density and the radiation density. The bayesian statistics will be adopted to calculate the posterior probability distribution of the parameters given the experimental supernovae distances, which will be used to determine the likelihood function. We will implement the emcee algorithm to generate samples with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model using the posterior probability distribution. Finally, the results will be plotted in the space of parameters.
