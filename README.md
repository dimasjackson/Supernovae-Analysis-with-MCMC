# Supernovae-Analysis-with-MCMC

In this project we use the distance data of 1701 Supernovae to estimate cosmological parameters. We constructed a non-naive Bayes classifier from scratch to fit the luminosity distance curve.  The values that optimizes the likelihood was used to generate samples of the parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The final parameters founded are in agreement with recent observations released by Planck Satellite.
